# week-4-game

In this game, the computer chooses a random number at the beginning. The objective of the player is to click on the crystal buttons to add up their total score to the computer's number. 

The catch is that the player cannot see the randomly generated numbers of the crystals and will need to watch their addition for each click. 

If the player adds up the crystal numbers, randomly generated each time a new game is played, to the computer's number they win! However, if they go over the computer number, they lose.
